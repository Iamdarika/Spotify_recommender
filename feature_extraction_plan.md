# Feature Extraction Plan

## 1. Feature Extraction
- It will focus on extracting important features from the dataset.
- This step ensures that only relevant attributes are used for model training and evaluation.
- Techniques may include preprocessing, transformation, and selecting significant data points.

## 2. MPI Placeholder (Preparation)
- It will prepare the code structure to integrate MPI (Message Passing Interface).
- This will allow parallelization across multiple nodes in the future.
- For now, I will create a placeholder section in the code to show where MPI logic will be added.
